Ciao 👋

I am originally from Milano 🇮🇹 and moved to Paris 🇫🇷 a few years ago.
I hold a bachelor's degree in Economics and Computer Science and a master's degree in Data Science.
My professional journey began in Data at in Data at [Alan](https://alan.com/), after which I transitioned to full stack engineering at [Multis](https://multis.com/).
I also ventured into launching [Nolo Shield](https://noloshield.webflow.io/), a web3 antivirus, but the project was discontinued after a few months.

I am exploring new professional opportunities, with a growing interest in contributing to projects like [Lea](https://github.com/carbonfact/lea), a minimalist tool for data transformation.

Away from screens, I enjoy a few activities.<br/>
One such passion is brewing espresso ☕️.
I'm quite particular about my coffee: I prefer 12 grams of a very dark roast, enjoyed twice daily.
My brewing equipment of choice is the [La Pavoni Europiccola](https://www.lapavoni.com/it/prodotti/linea-domestica/europiccola-lusso) paired with the
[Eureka Mignon Specialità](https://www.eureka.co.it/en/catalogo/prodotti/macinacaff%C3%A8+on+demand/1/20.aspx) grinder.

Basketball 🏀 is another favorite pastime. Having played in the 4th and 5th national divisions in Italy, I recently joined a small club in Paris.
