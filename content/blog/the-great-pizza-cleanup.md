## Motivation

In an age where culinary creativity often crosses into the realm of the absurd, the sanctity of pizza is under threat. Everywhere you look, there's a new, wild rendition being labeled as 'pizza'. Not every round dough with toppings earns the right to be called a pizza.

In 'The Great Pizza Clean-Up', we embark on a flavourful journey, armed with [Lea](https://github.com/carbonfact/lea) and a dash of Italian flair, to distinguish the authentic from the outrageous.

It's time to restore the honour of this beloved dish, one data point at a time. Join me in redefining what truly makes a pizza, a pizza.

## The data

In my quest to showcase [Lea](https://github.com/carbonfact/lea)‚Äôs simplicity, I stumbled upon the perfect candidate: the [Pizza Place Sales dataset.](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?search=pizza%20place%20sales) It consists of a year's worth of sales from a fictitious pizza place, including the date and time of each order and the pizzas served, with additional details on the type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients.

But here's the twist: amongst these pizze lie some so wildly unconventional that they just can't make the cut.

With Lea's capabilities and a little help from the pizza police üö®, we're set to explore some intriguing aspects of our data, while carefully navigating around the pizza pretenders:

1. How many customers do we have each day? Are there any peak hours?
2. How many pizzas are typically in an order? Do we have any bestsellers?
3. How much money did we make this year? Can we identify any seasonality in the sales?

Join me as we slice through the data üçï

## Setting up

All the essential code for our analysis is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/LeonardoNatale/the-great-pizza-cleanup).

Our data journey begins with four key CSV files, which you'll find in the **`seeds/`** folder [here](https://github.com/LeonardoNatale/the-great-pizza-cleanup/tree/main/seeds). These files are the foundational ingredients of our pizza-themed exploration. Our goal is to integrate them into our DuckDB database under a **`raw`** schema, and [Lea](https://github.com/carbonfact/lea) is the tool that simplifies this process.

We organise our workspace by creating a **`views/`** folder, with a **`raw/`** subfolder within it, for managing our data transformations. Think of it as setting up the prep area for our data analysis. Here‚Äôs how we smoothly transfer our CSV files into DuckDB using pandas. It's important to note that the name of the dataframe will serve as the table name in DuckDB. Here's a quick glimpse of the process:

```python
import pathlib
import pandas as pd

here = pathlib.Path(__file__).parent
pizzas = pd.read_csv(here.parent.parent / "seeds" / "pizzas.csv")
```

Our project structure, ready for data processing, will resemble the following ‚¨áÔ∏è

```
views
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ raw
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ order_details.py
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ orders.py
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pizza_types.py
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pizzas.py
```

## Preparing the data

With our raw data now successfully loaded, it's time to roll up our sleeves and delve deeper. A closer inspection of the **`pizzas`** and **`pizza_types`** tables reveals an opportunity for merging to streamline our analysis.

Take, for example, the data for ‚ÄúBarbecue Chicken Pizza‚Äù (a choice that might raise a few Italian eyebrows ü§¢) in the **`pizzas`** table:

| pizza_id  | pizza_type_id | size | price |
| --------- | ------------- | ---- | ----- |
| bbq_ckn_s | bbq_ckn       | S    | 12.75 |
| bbq_ckn_m | bbq_ckn       | M    | 16.75 |
| bbq_ckn_l | bbq_ckn       | L    | 20.75 |

and from the `**pizza_types**` table:

| pizza_type_id | name                       | category | ingredients                                                                         |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| bbq_ckn       | The Barbecue Chicken Pizza | Chicken  | Barbecued Chicken, Red Peppers, Green Peppers, Tomatoes, Red Onions, Barbecue Sauce |

A more intuitive format would merge these details, like so:

| pizza_type_id | name                       | category | size | price |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | -------- | ---- | ----- |
| bbq_ckn       | The Barbecue Chicken Pizza | Chicken  | S    | 12.75 |
| bbq_ckn       | The Barbecue Chicken Pizza | Chicken  | M    | 16.75 |
| bbq_ckn       | The Barbecue Chicken Pizza | Chicken  | L    | 20.75 |

And we'll relocate the ingredients into a separate table:

| pizza_type_id | ingredient_name   |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| bbq_ckn       | Barbecued Chicken |
| bbq_ckn       | Red Peppers       |
| bbq_ckn       | Green Peppers     |
| bbq_ckn       | Tomatoes          |
| bbq_ckn       | Red Onions        |
| bbq_ckn       | Barbecue Sauce    |

Since our **`raw`** data is already nestled in our database, transforming it becomes a breeze with Lea. We can use a **`SELECT`** query for this transformation and place the resulting data in the **`staging/`** folder.

For example, our **`pizzas.sql`** file in the **`staging`** folder would look something like this:

```
SELECT
    pizza_type_id,
    name,
    category,
    size,
    price
FROM
    raw.pizzas
    JOIN raw.pizza_types USING (pizza_type_id)
```

We apply similar transformations to the **`orders`** and **`order_details`** data. For a detailed look at these queries, check out the [provided code](https://github.com/LeonardoNatale/pizza-engineering/blob/main/views/staging/orders.sql#L14).

After these steps, our **`views/`** folder is now neatly organized as follows ‚¨áÔ∏è:

```
views
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ raw
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ order_details.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ orders.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pizza_types.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pizzas.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ staging
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ orders.sql
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pizza_ingredients.sql
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pizzas.sql
```

With our data neatly prepped and staged, we're all set for the deep-dive analysis.
