## Motivation

In an age where culinary creativity often crosses into the realm of the absurd, the sanctity of pizza is under threat. Everywhere you look, there's a new, wild rendition being labeled as 'pizza'. Not every round dough with toppings earns the right to be called a pizza.

In 'The Great Pizza Clean-Up', we embark on a flavorful journey, armed with [Lea](https://github.com/carbonfact/lea) and a dash of Italian flair, to distinguish the authentic from the outrageous.

It's time to restore the honor of this beloved dish, one data point at a time. Join us in redefining what truly makes a pizza, a pizza.
